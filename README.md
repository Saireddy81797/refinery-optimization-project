<h1 align="center">🏭 Data-Driven Optimization of Crude Oil Refinery Operations Using Python</h1>

---

## 📌 Overview
This project applies **data analytics and optimization techniques** to enhance the performance of a **crude oil distillation process**.  
By analyzing real process data such as **temperature, pressure, and feed composition**, the model identifies **optimal operating conditions** to maximize yield and reduce energy consumption.

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Perform **data-driven analysis** of refinery process parameters.  
- Build **predictive regression models** to estimate yield under varying conditions.  
- Implement **Python-based optimization** for throughput and energy efficiency.  
- Generate **interactive 3D yield surface visualizations** using Plotly.  
- Deploy the analytical report and interactive visualization via **GitHub Pages**.

## 🧠 Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Collection & Cleaning
- Compiled real refinery operational data from process logs.  
- Handled missing values, outliers, and normalized the dataset for consistent scaling.  

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed process behavior using **correlation heatmaps** and **pairwise plots**.  
- Identified key influencing variables affecting product yield.  

### 3️⃣ Predictive Modeling
- Built **multiple linear and polynomial regression models** to predict yield.  
- Evaluated model accuracy using **R² scores**, **RMSE**, and **residual plots**.  

### 4️⃣ Optimization & Visualization
- Generated **interactive 3D yield surfaces** using Plotly.  
- Highlighted regions of maximum yield with respect to **temperature and pressure**.  

### 5️⃣ Deployment
- Deployed the complete visualization (`index.html`) using **GitHub Pages** for public access.
