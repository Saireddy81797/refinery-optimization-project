🏭 Data-Driven Optimization of Crude Oil Refinery Operations Using Python and MATLAB
📌 Overview

This project focuses on applying data analytics and optimization techniques to enhance the performance of a crude oil distillation unit in a refinery. Using real process parameters such as temperature, pressure, and feed composition, the model identifies optimal operating conditions to maximize yield, minimize energy consumption, and reduce inefficiencies.

🎯 Key Objectives

Analyze refinery operational data to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies.

Develop predictive models to estimate product yield based on varying process conditions.

Use Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) for statistical modeling and data visualization.

Employ MATLAB optimization algorithms for parameter tuning and process control.

Visualize results via interactive 3D surface plots using Plotly and deploy via GitHub Pages.

🧠 Methodology

Data Collection & Cleaning

Process parameters (temperature, pressure, reflux ratio) were collected and cleaned for analysis.

Missing values and outliers were treated using robust statistical techniques.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identified relationships between key process variables using correlation and scatter plots.

Conducted multivariate regression to understand the dependency of yield on control parameters.

Predictive Modeling

Built regression and polynomial curve-fitting models to estimate yield behavior.

Validated model accuracy using R² scores and residual error analysis.

Optimization & Simulation

Applied MATLAB-based optimization algorithms to derive optimal setpoints for energy efficiency.

Simulated yield response using Python to visualize 3D yield surfaces.
